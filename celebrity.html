            Billie Eilish is speaking her truth in a new Calvin Klein ad by
            revealing the reason behind her signature baggy clothes. In the
            brand’s all-new campaign, dubbed “I Speak My Truth In #MyCalvins,”
            Billie explains that she doesn't want the world to know everything
            about her, so she relies on fashion to protect herself.

          <p>
            Women wore heels with socks in the last century, but they did it
            mostly for practical reasons. When tights became popular, this habit
            completely outlived itself and even became considered an antitrend.
            But a couple of years ago, Rihanna breathed new life into it. The
            singer boldly combines bright socks with designer shoes. She once
            wore white mules with Gucci socks that cost $1,340.

            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            The hairstyle, named after the character of the iconic Friends TV
            series, became a prominent symbol of the ’90s. Aniston appeared
            wearing her new hairstyle in the twentieth episode of the show. The
            actress’s stylist decided that she needed to change her image up a
            bit, and he was right because after the series was released, all
            fashionistas of that time wanted to get “the Rachel.”

            Contrary to popular belief, this TV star was'nt the creator of
            contouring — this makeup technique appeared long before Kim
            Kardashian. But it was the reality star who made this trend
            wide-spread. This selfie that was taken back in 2012 forever changed
            the idea of ​​makeup.
